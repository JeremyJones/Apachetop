ABOUT

  apachetop is a `top` clone for one or more Apache web servers

  apachetop is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the activity
  and performance of one or more Apache web servers. It retrieves
  server status pages from each Apache server, combines their information
  and presents current status and total activity similar to `top`. It is
  largely based on the `mytop` utility written by Jeremy Zawodny.

INSTALLATION

  tar -zxvf apachetop-<version>.tar.gz
  cd apachetop-<version>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Review apachetop.conf.example and edit it appropriately for your server,
then save it as apachetop.conf
